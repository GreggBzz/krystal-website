      <p>Krystal Rose Ledoux completed a series called �Bad Habits,� in graduate school, that is contemporary, hard edge, and pop.&nbsp; Of late, Krystal is concentrating on flower studies and the use of oil paints, though acrylic had been a popular medium for her unique style which frequently utilizes finger painting.&nbsp; As you will observe if you see her walking around the studio; her hands and apron are generally covered with paint.&nbsp; Finger painting, like brush strokes, helps her achieve the strokes and texture she desires in the painting.&nbsp; Krystal�s paintings are always on canvas; sometimes smaller canvases are added to supplement to the larger ones.&nbsp; The smaller paintings, in comparison with the larger canvases, offer a different perspective of the subject at hand.<br />
        &nbsp; <br />
        Krystal graduated from Marywood University with a Masters of Fine Arts in painting in May 2009. &nbsp; She student-taught both BFA Painting and Painting I undergraduate classes from 2008 through 2009 while enrolled at Marywood. &nbsp;Krystal graduated in 2003, as an art major, from Spring-Ford High School in Royersford. &nbsp;She later attended Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Krystal spent four years at Albright, graduating in 2007 with a Bachelors of Arts in Fine Arts and a minor in Art History.<br />
        <br />
      Since her first year at Albright College, Krystal had an enthusiastic interest in and was employed by art museums and galleries.&nbsp; Krystal has previously worked and/or completed internships at the Freedman Gallery at Albright College, the Berman Museum of Art at Ursinus College, Hickory Museum of Art in Hickory, North Carolina, and Trappe Historical Society in Trappe, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Her professional, educational, and artistic backgrounds have helped her gain experience to shape her career goal of becoming a college professor.<br /><br />
	  She currently resides in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where she continues to paint and share her art through showings in local galleries.</p>
